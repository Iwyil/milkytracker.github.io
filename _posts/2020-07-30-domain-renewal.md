A couple of years ago I was contacted by the owner of the domain name <http://milkytracker.org>, who after some time had a change of heart and kindly decided to help us out one last time by transferring ownership of the domain to us. We really appreciate this, and I am thrilled that we can now keep this domain maintained and pointing to the project we all love, and so for that, you have our sincere gratitude. Thankyou!

Since then, I have gladly been renewing this domain when it expired, and whilst it isn't a huge amount of money, it's _something_, and when the expiry date drew nearer this year, I thought I'd [reach out to the community][twitterpost] for help with the costs.

The response has been absolutely phenomenal, and I was amazed by the generosity of MilkyTracker's users and supporters.

I'm delighted to announce that as of today, <http://milkytracker.org> has now been renewed for **5** years, and we won't need to worry about the domain until the **23rd of August, 2025**!

Our sincere thanks go out to all who donated to the domain fund, including:

  * arabek
  * Mantratronic
  * Marcus Karlbowski 
  * Matt Forshaw
  * PROTODOME
  * syphus

We can also be equally grateful to the supporters who preferred to stay anonymous, so many thanks to you too - please get in touch if I've made a mistake and you'd like to be added to the list!

Finally, we have made some changes to how our domains are set up:

  * <http://milkytracker.org> now directly resolves to GitHub Pages, our web host. **This is now the primary address for the website**.
  * <http://milkytracker.titandemo.org> is now a redirect that will forward you to <http://milkytracker.org>. Shoutout to neoman of TiTAN for assisting with reconfiguring the subdomain!

We hope you are all doing well during this strange and disruptive year with the pandemic and all, so stay safe and keep on tracking!
