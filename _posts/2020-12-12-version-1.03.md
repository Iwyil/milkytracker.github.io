I am pleased to announce the latest release of MilkyTracker - version 1.03.

Since the previous release, we have added a few more features, usability improvements and of course bugfixes - see the [ChangeLog]({% link docs/ChangeLog.md %}) for details.

The latest Windows & MacOS binaries are available on the [GitHub release page][gitrel].

Work on the Amiga version of MilkyTracker is ongoing, head over to [AmigaPorts fork][amigaports] if this sparks your interest.

Happy tracking!
