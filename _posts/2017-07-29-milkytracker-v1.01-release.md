I am pleased to announce the latest release of MilkyTracker - version 1.01.

This release incorporates the usual [bug-fixes][gitissues] for issues reported on our GitHub tracker, in addition to the following new features:

* Channel limit increase to 128 channels (check out all those 'scopes!).
* New sample editor filters:
    *  Phase modulation
    *  AM & FM modulation
    *  Selective equaliser

Thanks to pailes for the work on the channel limit increase and Corvus Corax for the sample editor work. Detailed descriptions of the latter can be found in the original [pull requests][gitpull] on GitHub. Thanks also go to Henri Isoj√§rvi for fixes to the GUS patch loader and improvements to the GUI checkboxes.

Please refer to our detailed [ChangeLog]({% link docs/ChangeLog.md %}) for details of the changes since the previous release. Head over to the [GitHub release page][gitrel] to obtain the OSX/Windows binaries, or the source code to build your own.

Happy tracking!
