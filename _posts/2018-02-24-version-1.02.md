I am pleased to announce the latest release of MilkyTracker - version 1.02.

This is mainly a bug-fix release, but does add a couple of new features also - see the [ChangeLog]({% link docs/ChangeLog.md %}) for details.

Thanks go out to neuschaefer for performing [fuzzing][fuzzing] on MilkyTracker, discovering multiple potential memory corruption bugs in the various module importers. Thanks also to SagaMusix for providing fixes for these as well as some playback errors.

Head over to the [GitHub release page][gitrel] to obtain the OSX/Windows binaries, or the source code to build your own.

Those interested in running MilkyTracker on one of the various Amiga platforms (OS3.x, OS4.x, WarpOS, MorphOS, AROS) should check out the [AmigaPorts fork][amigaports].

Happy tracking!
